                <p>Dying to be the same<br>
                As I was before I met you<br>
                Don't wanna sleep away<br>
                The moments that I run to</p>
            </div>

            <div class="verse">
                <p>'Cause the world just feels so sterile now<br>
                And no one seems to mind<br>
                Did you notice how the colors seem to fade?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="verse">
                <p>I found a picture<br>
                It reminds me of a little while<br>
                Where a smile could last a while<br>
                And the world was really mine</p>
            </div>

            <div class="verse">
                <p>When did I turn into the one I always hated?<br>
                How did this happen? Now I'm always feeling jaded</p>
            </div>

            <div class="verse">
                <p>How could I know if this is where I'm meant to be?<br>
                If I'm always looking back at the shadows<br>
                Reaching for what used to be</p>
            </div>

            <div class="verse">
                <p>Oh it all comes back now<br>
                And I think I know how</p>
            </div>

            <div class="verse">
                <p>One look in the mirror<br>
                An older self stares back at me<br>
                With a smile that's been gone a while<br>
                A smile that broke free</p>
            </div>

            <div class="verse">
                <p>As time moves on<br>
                It's all the same old song<br>
                It scares me how my life here keeps on racing</p>
            </div>

            <div class="verse">

            <div class="verse">
                <p>Oh it's time to set free<br>
                For the whole world to see<br>
                This change begins with me</p>

                <p>'Cause the world just feels so sterile now<br>
                And it's no one's fault but mine<br>
                Oh life's too short<br>
                I'm running out of time</p>
