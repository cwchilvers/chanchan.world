                <p>Wake up, the day slips by<br>
                Another day slips through my hands<br>
                Oh, why can't life just slow down?<br>
                Can't have a moment to appreciate<br>
                What's 'round</p>
            </div>

            <div class="verse">
                <p>But no, I have to go<br>
                Have to keep on moving<br>
                'Til my body says no — oh, oh<br>
                When the curtain falls<br>
                And it's time to end the show</p>
            </div>

            <div class="verse">
                <p>Two steps, oh, I'm going to break<br>
                Another<br>
                Two steps that I'm going to take<br>
                I guess I'll<br>
                Fall<br>
                Gonna take a leap and risk it all</p>
            </div>

            <div class="verse">
                <p>Relax, just take a breath<br>
                Just try to stay calm<br>
                You got this — don't think wrong<br>
                It's in your palm<br>
                This moment's yours<br>
                Pull together, you must be strong</p>
            </div>

            <div class="verse">
                <p>With all that's wrong<br>
                With steady hands, you will carry on<br>
                It won't be long<br>
                When you put in the effort, you'll find that song<br>
                Keep hold, and you'll find that very song<br>
                With time, you will find your song</p>
            </div>

            <div class="verse">
                <p>Two steps, oh, I'm going to break<br>
                Another<br>
                Two steps that I'm going to take<br>
                I know I'll<br>
                Fall<br>
                Gonna take this leap<br>
                Gonna take it all</p>

            <div class="verse">
                <p>The greatest glory in living<br>
                Lies not in never falling,<br>
                But in rising<br>
                Every time we fall</p>
